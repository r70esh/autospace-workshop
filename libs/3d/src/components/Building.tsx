// this component is used to render a building in a 3D scene.
// It creates a series of squares stacked vertically to represent the floors of the building.
// The number of floors is determined by the `floors` prop, which defaults to 3.
// Each square is positioned based on the `position` prop and the `FLOOR_HEIGHT` constant.
